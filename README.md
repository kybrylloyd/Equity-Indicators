# Equity-Indicators
https://www.houstontx.gov/onecompletehouston/

The City of Houston, in partnership with the Kinder Institute for Urban Research, developed equity indicators to compare data on 63 topical areas that measure whether opportunities are equally available to all Houstonians. The data coalesces into scores, called an Equity Indicators. The City prepared its first Equity Indicators Report comparing data from 2021 and 2022. Thanks to funding from Shell USA, Inc, this report will influence decision-makers on budget priorities, programming, policies, and projects to achieve equitable outcomes.

The collaborative work of the Houston Planning and Development Department, the Mayor's Office of Resilience and Sustainability, and the Mayor's Office of Complete Communities aligned with the Kinder Institute's work on the vision and framework outlined in the Resilient Houston strategy and the 10 Complete Communities Action Plans.

In addition to the statistical analysis, a hubsite was created to display all mappable indicators.
